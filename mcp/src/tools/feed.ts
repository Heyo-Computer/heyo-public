/**
 * The per-namespace event feed — "what happened to my deployments".
 *
 * app-lb keeps a ring of lifecycle and issue events per namespace and serves it
 * as RSS at `GET /feeds/:namespace`, with `?format=json` for anything that
 * would rather not parse XML. Three properties decide how a client should use
 * it, and none of them is obvious from the URL:
 *
 * **It is a pull, not a push.** Nothing is delivered; something has to ask. A
 * client that wants event-driven behaviour polls, and the ring is sized for a
 * reader that polls occasionally rather than constantly (200 events, and
 * repeats of the same issue fold into one entry inside a 5-minute window rather
 * than appending — so a flapping deployment cannot flood a poller).
 *
 * **No subscription state is held anywhere.** app-lb does not track who has
 * read what; there is no per-reader watermark and no "unread". The cursor is
 * the caller's to keep — which is why {@link feedTools} takes `since_id` and
 * hands back `latest_id`, so keeping it is one field rather than a design.
 *
 * **The ring is in memory.** An app-lb restart empties it and event ids start
 * again from zero, so a saved `since_id` can be *higher* than anything in a
 * fresh feed. That is not an error and must not read as one: the tool detects
 * it and says the feed was reset, rather than silently returning nothing for
 * ever. Timestamps are the durable ordering; the record of what actually
 * happened is app-obs and the job history, not this.
 *
 * **Nothing publishes by default.** A deployment contributes only if its spec
 * says `feed.announce` or `feed.issues`. An empty feed usually means no
 * deployment opted in, not that nothing happened.
