//! Response actions: the rules that turn a finding into an intervention.
//!
//! [`crate::siem`] decides that something is an attack. This is what an operator
//! can *do* about it without leaving app-lb — block an address, block a pattern
//! of traffic, and take it back off again. The two halves are deliberately
//! separate: detection is advisory and runs off the request path on its own
//! task, while enforcement is authoritative and runs *on* the request path, so
//! everything here is written to a different standard of cost and blast radius.
//!
//! ## What a rule can say
//!
//! One [`RuleMatch`] is a conjunction of literal conditions — a client prefix, a
//! hostname, a deployment, a path prefix or substring, a method, a user-agent
//! substring. Every condition that is present must hold. Absent conditions are
//! not wildcards to be evaluated; they are simply not checked.
//!
//! **No regular expressions, deliberately.** A rule is authored during an
//! incident, by someone under time pressure, and evaluated on every request to
//! the data plane. A pathological pattern would turn a mitigation into the
//! outage it was meant to prevent, and there is no expressive gap worth that:
//! the signatures that need regex live in the SIEM, which runs off the hot path
//! and can afford one.
//!
//! ## The three things that keep this from becoming the incident
//!
//! * **An empty match is refused.** `{}` is a conjunction of nothing, which is
//!   true of every request — one click from the dashboard would take the whole
//!   data plane down. [`RuleSpec::build`] rejects it rather than trusting the
//!   caller to have meant it.
//! * **The admin plane is never guarded.** Rules are consulted by
//!   [`crate::proxy`] and nowhere else, so however badly an operator blocks
//!   themselves out of the data plane, the dashboard that removes the rule is
//!   still reachable. This is the escape hatch and it must stay one.
//! * **Rules can expire.** Every suggested action the SIEM offers carries a
//!   bounded lifetime, because the realistic failure is not a missing block, it
//!   is a permanent one that outlives the attack and quietly breaks a customer
//!   six weeks later.
//!
//! `APP_LB_GUARD_ENFORCE=0` is a fourth: rules still match and still count, but
//! nothing is refused. That is how a broad rule gets deployed sanely — watch
//! what it would have caught for an hour first.
//!
//! ## Storage
//!
//! [`ArcSwap`], unlike [`crate::siem::AlertRing`]'s mutex, and the contrast is
//! the point: this list is read on every single request and written by hand a
//! few times a week, and a write replaces it wholesale rather than mutating an
//! entry. Hit counters are atomics *inside* the `Arc<Rule>`, so counting a match
//! costs one relaxed add and never a swap.
//!
//! Rules are persisted, because a restart that silently unblocks an active
//! attacker is a worse failure than any of the above.
