//! Which runtime boots a deployment's replicas.
//!
//! app-lb has two: heyvmd, which boots Firecracker/KVM microVMs
//! ([`crate::vm`]), and Incus, which boots system containers from OCI images
//! ([`crate::incus`]). This is the seam between them.
//!
//! **An enum, not a trait**, and the reason is that the two are not symmetric.
//! Thirteen of [`VmManager`]'s methods are heyvm-only — trees, catalog images,
//! proxy binds, the disk routes, mount export — and a trait would have to carry
//! all of them as `Err(Unsupported)` stubs on the Incus side, turning a fact the
//! compiler knows into one discovered at runtime. `VmManager` is also held by
//! value in six places, of which only the autoscaler needs the seam at all.
//! Callers that want the heyvm-only surface ask for it by name via
//! [`Runtime::heyvm`], and get a `VmManager` rather than a maybe.
//!
//! The shared vocabulary is the SDK's: [`SandboxInfo`], `SandboxStatus`,
//! `SandboxUsage`. Reusing it is what lets `promote_pending`, `prune`,
//! `routable_addr`, `is_terminal` and the dashboard work on containers without
//! knowing containers exist.
