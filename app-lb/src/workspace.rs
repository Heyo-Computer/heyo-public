//! Deployment-owned workspaces: a writable directory that outlives the VM.
//!
//! The spec side is [`WorkspaceSpec`]; this module is the host side — where the
//! tree lives, how a retiring VM's disk becomes the next VM's seed, and how a
//! snapshot gets to and from the durable store. The autoscaler calls in at
//! three points, and everything else is the worker behind them:
//!
//! * [`Workspaces::seed_for_create`] — before a replica is created: the tree to
//!   hand heyvmd, or the reason there is not one yet (a capture in flight, a
//!   restore pending). The autoscaler skips the create in that case and asks
//!   again next tick; a workspace deployment is never booted from a stale tree.
//! * [`Workspaces::retire`] — when a replica leaves the pool for any reason:
//!   the guest is synced, the VM is stopped, and a capture is queued. What
//!   happens to the VM afterwards (destroyed, or kept suspended for
//!   `idle_action: retain`) is decided now and carried out by the worker once
//!   the capture has landed, so a VM is never destroyed with state that has not
//!   been copied out of it.
//! * [`Workspaces::blocked`] — the one-line reason, for logs and for the
//!   deployment status, that a pool is sitting at zero.
//!
//! ## Layout
//!
//! ```text
//! /var/lib/app-lb/workspaces/<deployment>/
//!   state.json                 what is current, what was pushed, who was seeded from what
//!   snapshots/<digest>/        extracted trees; `current` is the one the next VM gets
//!   empty/                     the tree a workspace starts from when the store has nothing
//!   bundles/<digest>.tar.gz    the snapshot as sent to (or fetched from) the store
//!   staging-<token>[.tar.gz]   a capture or restore in progress
//! ```
//!
//! Snapshots are named by the sha256 of their bundle, which makes "is the
//! store's copy the one we have?" a string comparison and makes a partially
//! written tree impossible to mistake for a finished one — it is never under
//! its final name until it is complete.
//!
//! ## Lineage
//!
//! Every VM is seeded from exactly one snapshot, and that is recorded
//! (`seeds`) when it is created. A capture is accepted only from a VM whose seed
//! is the **current** snapshot. That rule is what keeps the history linear: a
//! replica that was seeded from an older snapshot — an orphan the autoscaler
//! found late, a resume of a VM from before a rollout — cannot overwrite the
//! work of the one that replaced it. Such a VM is kept, stopped, for an
//! operator to look at (`/disks` lists it), rather than captured or destroyed.
//!
//! The same rule applies on the store side: a push refuses to move the tag if
//! the store holds a snapshot this host has never seen, which is what a
//! deployment moving between hosts looks like from here.
//!
//! ## What runs as what
//!
//! None of this needs root. `debugfs` reads the ext4 image directly (`rdump`),
//! `mke2fs -d` builds the next one from a directory, and both are part of
//! e2fsprogs, which heyvmd already requires. The cost is that ownership is
//! flattened to app-lb's own uid; modes, symlinks and mtimes survive. The image
//! is `e2fsck`'d before it is read, because heyvmd stops a Firecracker VM by
//! killing it and the journal is therefore always dirty.
