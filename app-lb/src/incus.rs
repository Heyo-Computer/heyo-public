//! The Incus boundary, for `driver: lxc` deployments.
//!
//! What [`crate::vm`] is to heyvmd, this is to Incus: everything that knows how
//! a container is created, listed, addressed and destroyed lives here.
//!
//! Three things are worth stating up front, because each is a trap:
//!
//! 1. **A `Running` container with no address yet is normal**, for the second or
//!    two it takes DHCP to settle. [`crate::vm::routable_addr`] treats a missing
//!    address as *terminal* — see the `Err(e)` arm of `promote_pending` — so
//!    reporting `Running` before an address exists would make the autoscaler
//!    kill healthy containers on boot. [`to_sandbox_info`] therefore reports
//!    [`SandboxStatus::Provisioning`] until an address is present, which keeps
//!    the autoscaler on its existing non-terminal branch.
//! 2. **Ownership lives in `user.app-lb.*`, not only in the name.** Incus names
//!    are DNS labels (1–63 chars, `[A-Za-z0-9-]`, no leading digit or dash, no
//!    trailing dash), and app-lb deployment ids are only checked for non-empty.
//!    `DeploymentSpec::validate` refuses an id that cannot make a legal name, so
//!    `vm::owner_of` still round-trips — but the config keys are what a human
//!    running `incus list` reads, and what a second app-lb on the same host uses
//!    to avoid adopting containers that are not its own.
//! 3. **The API is asynchronous.** A create answers `202` with an operation id
//!    and the instance appears later. That is the shape app-lb already wants:
//!    `scale_up` holds a fleet-wide permit across the create, so blocking until
//!    boot would serialize the pool behind the slowest image pull.
