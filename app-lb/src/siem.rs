//! Detecting attacks in what app-lb already sees.
//!
//! [`crate::obs`] records *what happened*. Nothing there decides whether what
//! happened was an attack, and three things follow from that which this module
//! exists to fix:
//!
//! * **Authentication failure was invisible.** The admin gate answered a bad
//!   credential with a 401 and logged nothing at all, so a password spray against
//!   `/dashboard` left no trace anywhere.
//! * **Scanner traffic was noticed and thrown away.** `/wp-login.php` probes
//!   already accumulate in the unrouted access log; nothing read them.
//! * **Anomalies were only visible to somebody watching.** `crate::metrics`
//!   would show a 5xx surge on the dashboard, to whoever happened to be looking.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! A second, independent pipeline beside [`crate::obs`] — not a tee inside
//! [`crate::obs::LogSink`]. That is deliberate: `obs::from_env` returns `None`
//! whenever `APP_LB_OBS_URL` is unset, so a SIEM living inside it would silently
//! not exist on every host without a log collector, which is the opposite of what
//! a security control should do. This one is on unless `APP_LB_SIEM=0`.
//!
//! ```text
//! proxy::logging ─┐
//! admin::authorize├─→ SecuritySink ──try_send──→ Engine ──→ AlertRing ──→ GET /security
//! auth sign-in   ─┘   (bounded queue)            │          (in memory)
//!                                                └────────→ obs::LogSink → app-obs
//!                                                           source="security"
//! ```
//!
//! # This must never become a dependency of the data plane
//!
//! The same invariant [`crate::obs`] holds, for the same reason and by the same
//! means: recording is a `try_send` into a bounded queue and nothing else. No
//! lock, no await, no I/O, no `SiemLog` construction on the request path. A SIEM
//! that can add latency to a request is a SIEM that gets switched off. When the
//! queue is full, observations are dropped and counted — and because *that*
//! failure mode makes a busy network look quiet, [`SiemSnapshot::dropped`] and
//! [`SiemSnapshot::clients_at_capacity`] are reported on `/metrics`, on
//! `/security` and on the dashboard rather than hidden in a counter.
//!
//! # What is borrowed from `u-siem`, and what is not
//!
//! The crate supplies the *vocabulary*: [`SiemLog`] as an ECS-shaped field bag,
//! [`SiemField`], the field-name constants, and the [`LogParser`] /
//! [`LogEnrichment`] traits. Normalizing through them is what makes an app-lb
//! security log indexable next to anything else ECS-shaped, and it keeps these
//! parsers liftable into a real u-siem kernel later without a rewrite.
//!
//! It does **not** supply windowing. `SiemRule::matches` sees one log and no
//! history, so "5 auth failures from one address in 60 seconds" — two of the
//! three detection categories here — is not expressible in it. Those are plain
//! Rust in [`Windows`]. Rule state in u-siem is fed by kernel-side machinery
//! behind `SiemDatasetManager`, which app-lb deliberately does not run. Signature
//! matching also uses one [`RegexSet`] pass rather than `RuleOperator::Matches`
//! per subrule, because it sits on a per-request path.
//!
//! # Bounded by construction
//!
//! Unbounded per-client state is how a detector becomes the vulnerability. Two
//! rules, both load-bearing, both tested:
//!
//! * Every window is a fixed ring of time buckets and distinct-path counting is
//!   a 64-bit sketch — never a `Vec` of timestamps or a set of strings. Cost per
//!   tracked client is constant, and no attacker-controlled string is retained.
//! * At [`SiemConfig::max_clients`] the table sweeps expired entries and then
//!   *drops the new observation* rather than evicting a live one. Evicting the
//!   least-recently-seen is precisely what an attacker engineers, by flooding
//!   fresh addresses to push their own activity out of the table.
