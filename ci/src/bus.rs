//! The JetStream job queue.
//!
//! ## Subjects are sharded per runner, and that is the whole design
//!
//! `WorkQueue` retention deletes a message on ack, so the stream's depth *is*
//! the backlog — self-clearing, and exactly what a dashboard wants to show. The
//! cost is that JetStream permits **only one consumer per subject** under that
//! policy, which is why queue-fn documents itself as single-instance.
//!
//! Sharding the subject by runner sidesteps it entirely. One durable pull
//! consumer per runner, each filtering a subject nothing else filters, means
//! several orchestrators can run at once as long as they own disjoint runner
//! sets. The constraint stops being a limit and starts being the partitioning
//! scheme.
//!
//! Two disjoint subject spaces:
//!
//! ```text
//! <prefix>.job.r.<runner_id>     pinned to one host
//! <prefix>.job.n.<network_id>    any online host in that network
//! ```
//!
//! The `r`/`n` segment is load-bearing. Without it a network happening to be
//! named `hd-something` — or a runner named after a network — would produce
//! overlapping filters, and under `WorkQueue` two consumers would silently
//! consume each other's work. Both tokens are machine-generated ids
//! (`hd-…`, `net-…`), so neither needs escaping; both are checked anyway.
//!
//! ## What is *not* on the bus
//!
//! **Step logs.** They are megabytes per job and JetStream is the wrong medium;
//! they go to disk with offsets in Postgres.
//!
//! **The job's plan.** A message carries ids only. The database is the source of
//! truth, so a redelivery runs what the original delivery would have, even if
//! the branch moved underneath it.
//!
//! **heyvm's own stream.** `HEYO_MVM_CMD` / `mvm.cmd.<backend>.{create,delete}`
//! carries VM lifecycle with its own retention and dispatcher. Sharing it would
//! mean a purge here destroying pending VM creates there.
