# Install app-lb, app-obs, ci and art from the artifact store the workflows
# push to. `codegraph` and `queue` are published too and installable by name.
#
#   ART_URL=https://art.example.com ART_API_KEY=… sh .ci/install.sh
#   curl -fsSL https://…/install.sh | ART_URL=… ART_API_KEY=… sh
#
# The counterpart of `.ci/workflows/`: those build the binaries and push them to
# an `art serve`, and this pulls the newest of each back out and puts it where
# the shipped supervisor units expect to find it.
#
# ## Usage
#
#   sh .ci/install.sh [--list] [--dry-run] [--restart] [--ref TAG] [app...]
#
#   --list      Show what the store has, with each artifact's description, and
#               install nothing.
#   --dry-run   Resolve and download everything, verify it, and report what
#               would be installed without touching the host.
#   --restart   `supervisorctl update` and restart each installed program.
#               Off by default: when to bounce a running orchestrator is not a
#               decision an installer should make.
#   --ref TAG   Install this exact tag instead of the newest, for one app.
#               A rollback: `--ref ci-app-lb-019f…-release-app-lb app-lb`.
#
# ## Environment
#
#   ART_URL          Base URL of the `art serve` (required).
#   ART_API_KEY      Bearer token for it (required unless the store is open).
#                    Needed even though the tarballs are public: this script
#                    resolves *tags*, and only the blobs behind them are open.
#   PREFIX           Binaries go in $PREFIX/bin. Default /usr/local.
#   STATE_ROOT       Per-service state. Default /var/lib. `ci`'s migrations land
#                    in $STATE_ROOT/ci/migrations, which is what CI_MIGRATIONS_DIR
#                    in the shipped ci.conf points at.
#   SUPERVISOR_DIR   Where supervisor program files go. Default
#                    /etc/supervisor/conf.d. Set empty to skip them entirely.
#   APPS             Which to install. Default "app-lb app-obs ci art".
#                    `codegraph` and `queue` are also published and installable
#                    by name. `queue` is out of the default set on purpose: it
#                    is a dashboard for a NATS server, so it belongs only on the
#                    host running one, and installing it elsewhere would leave a
#                    supervisor program failing its scrape forever.
#                    `art` is in the default set because app-lb needs it on
#                    the same host: a deployment whose `vm.workspace.store`
#                    is a local path is restored and captured by app-lb
#                    running `art` (`APP_LB_ART_BIN`), and a host without it
#                    holds that deployment's pool at zero replicas.
#
# ## How an artifact is found
#
# `ci` tags every upload `ci-<workflow>-<run>-<job>-<name>` (see
# `ci/src/artifacts.rs`), because the store's tag charset has no `/`. For the
# six things these workflows publish that is:
#
#   ci-app-lb-<run>-release-app-lb       app-lb + heyctl
#   ci-app-obs-<run>-release-app-obs     app-obs + app-obs-dump
#   ci-ci-<run>-release-ci               ci + its migrations
#   ci-codegraph-<run>-release-codegraph codegraph
#   ci-art-<run>-release-art             art
#   ci-queue-<run>-release-queue         queue
#
# The run id is `%012x-%08x` — epoch milliseconds in hex, then a sequence — so
# it is fixed-width and zero-padded, and **sorting the tags lexicographically
# sorts them chronologically**. That is the one non-obvious thing this script
# depends on; if run ids ever stop being fixed-width hex, `newest_tag` silently
# starts picking the wrong build rather than failing, so the pattern below
# matches the exact widths as a tripwire.
#
# ## What it verifies
#
# A blob's name *is* the sha256 of its bytes, so checking the download against
# the digest it was fetched by is free and catches a truncated transfer, a proxy
# that helpfully rewrote something, or a store serving the wrong content. Then
# `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS` runs inside the unpacked tree, which is the build's
# own statement about the files it produced.
#
# ## What it will not do
#
# **It never overwrites a supervisor config.** Those hold edited secrets — the
# shipped `app-lb.conf` ships `APP_LB_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD="change-me"` and every
# real deployment has changed it — so an upgrade that replaced them would revert
# production configuration without saying so. An existing file is left alone and
# the new one is written beside it as `<name>.conf.new`.
